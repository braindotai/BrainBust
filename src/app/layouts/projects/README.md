# Moon Racoons - Team for Open Innovative Challenge Hackathon

# Problem Statement

Ever since the pandemic, all educational institutes and other educational systems have started functioning remotely.
This is usually okay for short time interval, but because of the limited control over COVID 19 pandemic, these institute would be closed for the foreseeable future.

So, children in every country are almost immobile, to the extent that causes serious health issues and diseases such as **Venous Thrombosis**, **Bedsores**, **Muscle Atrophy**, **Movement Disorders**... etc, which are highly dangerous and common diseases among children. 

# Solution

- We proposes a platform for Yoga Competition, where children would be able to compete among other children.

- Our system would have the knowledge of what a correct yoga pose looks like.

- Using state of the art pose estimation and classification models in deep learning, our system would detect features through poses of children, and compared them with the correct poses.

- Bases on the comparisons, we would provide full analysis report of how well each child has performed.

- And finally we'll conclude the winner of the competition.

- After a certain days, our system would also provide temporal analysis of how the overall performance has improved or affected for each child.
